# LapseRate_modeling
The aim is to use ML to 1) project the lapse potential of insurance clients at point of inception (first premium paid) and 2) to predict near future lapses.

EDA is jpt notebook for doing exploratory data analysis. Getting correlations and plotting distributions. Then cleaning and transforming the data based on these results. This is for both objectives.

Model_comp is for running multiple models to see which models and with or withour resampling or class weight do the best. The best models can then be investigated further.

at_incept_modeling is exploring the better performing models to then choose the best.

At_Inception_Models is the finalized models for the different targets for the at inception objective.
